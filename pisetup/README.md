# StuffedAnimalWar Pi Setup

Raspberry Pi configuration for dual-mode WiFi operation by Jaemzware LLC.

## Overview

This setup allows your Raspberry Pi to operate in two modes:

1. **AP Mode** - Creates a wireless access point for "in the woods" use (no internet required)
2. **Home WiFi Mode** - Connects to your home network for local LAN access

The Pi automatically falls back to AP mode if it can't connect to your saved WiFi network.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (or any Pi with WiFi)
- MicroSD card (8GB minimum)
- Power supply

## Services Included

- **StuffedAnimalWar** - Chat and media sharing platform
- **AnalogArchive** - Audio streaming service (optional)

## Installation

### 1. Prepare SD Card

Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) to your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.

**Important Imager Settings:**
- **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)
- **Hostname:** `stuffedanimalwar` (without .local)
- **Username:** `jaemzware` (CRITICAL - scripts expect this exact username)
- **Password:** Set your own password
- **Configure wireless LAN:** **CHECK** and enter your WiFi credentials (temporary, for initial setup only)
- **Enable SSH:** **CHECK** (required for initial setup)
- **Enable telemetry:** **UNCHECK** (optional, for privacy)

**Note:** You're configuring WiFi temporarily so you can SSH in and run the installer. After installation, you'll remove these credentials so the Pi starts in AP mode.

### 2. Install Git and Clone Repositories

```bash
# Install git (not included in Raspberry Pi OS Lite by default)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git

cd /home/jaemzware

# Clone StuffedAnimalWar (main repository with setup scripts)
git clone https://github.com/jaemzware/stuffedanimalwar.git

# Clone AnalogArchive (optional, for audio streaming)
git clone https://github.com/jaemzware/analogarchivejs.git analogarchive

cd stuffedanimalwar
```

**Note:** The AnalogArchive repository is cloned as `analogarchive` (not `analogarchivejs`) to match the expected directory structure.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd pisetup
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Install nginx, NetworkManager, and other dependencies
- Generate self-signed SSL certificates
- Configure the access point
- Set up systemd services
- Offer to reboot

**Choose YES to reboot when prompted.**

After rebooting, the Pi will automatically start in AP mode (since no WiFi credentials are saved yet). Connect to the **StuffedAnimalWAP** access point (password: **stuffedanimal**) and SSH back in:

```bash
ssh jaemzware@stuffedanimalwar.local
```

### 4. Remove Initial WiFi Configuration

Now remove the temporary WiFi credentials that were set in the imager:

```bash
# Remove the WiFi configuration from the imager
sudo rm /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/preconfigured.nmconnection
```

You're now ready to test the `/setup` page!

### 5. First AP Mode Boot

On first boot (or when no WiFi credentials are saved):
- Pi starts in **AP Mode**
- Connect to WiFi: **StuffedAnimalWAP**
- Password: **stuffedanimal**
- Navigate to: `https://stuffedanimalwar.local/setup`
- Enter your home WiFi credentials
- Pi will reboot and connect to your home network

## Usage

### Accessing Services

**AP Mode (in the woods):**
- Connect to: StuffedAnimalWAP
- StuffedAnimalWar: `https://stuffedanimalwar.local`
- AnalogArchive: `https://analogarchive.local`

**Home WiFi Mode:**
- Ensure devices are on the same network as the Pi
- StuffedAnimalWar: `https://stuffedanimalwar.local`
- AnalogArchive: `https://analogarchive.local`

### Resetting WiFi

To return to AP mode:

**Method 1: Delete credentials file**
1. Power off Pi
2. Remove SD card
3. Delete `/home/jaemzware/stuffedanimalwar/wifi-credentials.json`
4. Reinsert card and boot

**Method 2: Automatic fallback**
- If the Pi can't connect to saved WiFi after 60 seconds, it automatically switches to AP mode
- This happens when you take it somewhere without your home WiFi

## Default AP Settings

- **SSID:** StuffedAnimalWAP
- **Password:** stuffedanimal
- **IP Address:** 192.168.4.1
- **DHCP Range:** 192.168.4.2-192.168.4.50

To change these, edit `install.sh` before running.

## Troubleshooting

**Can't access .local addresses:**
- Ensure avahi-daemon is running: `sudo systemctl status avahi-daemon`
- Try IP address instead: `https://192.168.4.1` (AP mode)

**Services won't start:**
- Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u stuffedanimalwar -n 50`
- Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`

**WiFi won't connect:**
- Check NetworkManager: `sudo systemctl status NetworkManager`
- View saved connections: `nmcli connection show`
- Manually test: `sudo nmcli connection up HomeWiFi`

**Certificate warnings:**
- Expected with self-signed certificates
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed" in your browser
- Certificate shows "Jaemzware LLC" organization
